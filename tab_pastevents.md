**How to Build Awesome Security Instrumentation to Automate AppSec Testing and Protection** <br>
>Modern software demands velocity, and traditional “outside in” scanning and firewalling are creating bottlenecks and slowing things down. In this talk, Jeff will approach application security from the “inside out”. We will show you how to create simple agents that get inside a running application (like a profiler or debugger) and give you access to everything you might want to know. We’ll demonstrate real agents that identify vulnerabilities without changing any code, scanning, or extra steps. We’ll identify vulnerabilities, analyze access control, and even prevent RCE attacks. Unlike scanning and firewalling, this approach establishes a safe and powerful way for development, security, and operations teams to collaborate. We’ll discuss how software security instrumentation works, how it’s being used in many organizations, and the implications for the practice of application security.

**You got Honey in my Web App** <br>
Let's face it, attackers seem to be holding all the advantages... but it doesn't have to be that way... With a little bit of creativity and understanding of how attackers actually do what they do, you can mount an effective defense that will leave your attackers openly weeping wondering where it all went wrong. Turns out... it was when they mistakenly started gunning for your web apps. Attendees of this talk will learn about how each layer of a web app stack can be made into the attackers' worst nightmare.
