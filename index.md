**Account Takeover: Data Findings, Popular Tools, and Prevalent Actors** <br>
In our latest account takeover (ATO) findings, we have observed a significant increase in credentials listed on the deep and dark web (15 billion and counting), tools that enable account takeover, and account takeover service advertisements on criminal marketplaces. This presentation highlights the sheer volume of account takeover, how ATO can impact your organization, and mitigation recommendations to keep your credentials safe.

By attending this session, you will take away:
- The size of the ATO problem
- Tools that attackers use for conducting ATO
- Current and evolved approaches to brute-forcing
- Best practices for preventing ATO
