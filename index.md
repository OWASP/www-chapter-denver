Stuck at home, but still want to test your skills in identifying web app vulnerabilities? OWASP Denver and Boulder chapters along with Security Innovation invite members to virtually compete in CMD+CTRL, a web application cyber range where players exploit their way through hundreds of vulnerabilities that lurk in business applications today. Success means learning quickly that attack and defense is all about thinking on your feet.

For each vulnerability you uncover, you are awarded points. Climb the interactive leaderboard for a chance to win prizes! The range is open to all skill levels so come and try your hand at this event!

All you need is your laptop and inner evil-doer!
